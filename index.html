            <p>
              With the advancement of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have significantly impacted sports communication, particularly in enhancing audience engagement, personalized content recommendations, real-time data analysis, and targeted advertising. Predicting sports outcomes remains a challenging task due to the inherent unpredictability of factors such as player performance, weather, and tactical decisions. Traditional statistical models and machine learning algorithms, like logistic regression and XGBoost, have had limited success in capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional data. This study explores the novel application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting sports event outcomes. Leveraging CNNs' ability to identify intricate patterns, the proposed method shows improved accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score compared to six traditional models, achieving up to 93%- 97%, 87.8%-92.2%, 91.5%-96.5% and 90.7-92.9 respectively. Besides, while there are some fluctuations influenced by Gaussian noise, the four targets of our model are still much higher than other traditional models, and both could show the stability and reliability of the model. The result of this finally indicates that CNN offers a promising method for enhancing sports analytics and permits reliable and accurate predictions of complicated datasets.

              This work is going to demonstrate the excellent capability of convolutional neural networks in predicting football game outcomes, further improving conventional machine learning models like logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forests.
The accuracy of about 95%, the precision of about 90%, the recall of about 94% and the F1 score of about 91.8, have proved that CNNs were much better at modelling the intrinsic pattern in sports data with little feature engineering compared to the other models. Second, it is evident from the research that a change in the number of convolutional layers and kernels does not really affect the overall accuracy, which stays around 95%, and keeping the feature “is won” and “point difference” might make the model more stabilized, removing the feature “is stake” might enhance the model’s performance. After the experiment of Gaussian noise, the four targets have a slight fluctuation, but all of them is around 90. This indeed reflects the robustness and reliability of CNNs in dealing with complex, high-dimensional data related to sports analytics. This research opens perspectives for further exploration in the domain of sports outcome forecasting using deep learning techniques. Further refinements in CNN architectures could be envisaged in further works by incorporating domain knowledge or proposing hybrid models to improve the reliability of predictions. Besides, scalability to other sports and types of data is an aspect that will be of interest for studying in greater detail. It is an exciting opportunity, indeed, to apply AI and big data in sports media and beyond.
